# Bugs
The bugs game 

In this programming competition, your job is to program an artificial species of ant using our specially-built programming language, called “Bugs!” Once you program your ant species, you’ll then be able to have it compete against other students' species within a virtual world to see which ant colony is the most prolific.

You can modify the CalAnt, StanfordAnt, UCLAAnt, USCAnt to program the ant, and you can run the Bugs exe file to play the game

Detailed explanation can be found in Manual.pdf, code can be found in CoreCode
