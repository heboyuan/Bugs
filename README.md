# Bugs
The bugs game 

In this programming competition, your job is to program an artificial species of ant using our specially-built programming language, called “Bugs!” Once you program your ant species, you’ll then be able to have it compete against other students' species within a virtual world to see which ant colony is the most prolific.

You can modify the Player1 to Player4 file to program the ant, and you can run the Bugs to play the game
